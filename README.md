Using the GIPHY API this dynamic web page populates with gifs based on user inputs

This web app is built around the theme of Harry Potter. The user can enter any search term into the input form and will be presented with 10 gifs using the GIPHY API that have a tag equal to their search. The user is also presented with the title and rating of each gif provided by the GIPHY API. The theme may be Harry Potter but the user is welcome to enter any search term. The gifs presented at first are the still image associated with the individual gif, and upon clicking each gif a switch is flipped between the still image and the active "playing" gif - this is to fake the appearance of them playing and pausing.

### Problem

Needed to display knowledge and understanding of GIPHY API and how to give the user the ability to search for a gif with any search term

### Solution

Created a Harry Potter-themed giphy api search that returned gifs, their title and their rating when the user inputed a search term.

### Tools Utilized

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Giphy API
